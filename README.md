Some comments:
  * For some algorithms on graphs an adjacency list representation is implemented, for some others an adjacency matrix
  * Naïve, divide-et-conquera and Strassen's algorithms are implemented for matrix multiplication
  * Naïve and dynamic programming solutions are implemented for chain matrix multiplication
  * Insertion and deletion of a node, search of the maximum, minimum and of an arbitrary value are implemented for the three data structures
  * Naïve and Knuth-Morris algorithms are implemented for pattern matching
  * The suffix tree is built using both brutal construction and McCreight`s algorithm
